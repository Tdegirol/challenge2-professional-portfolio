# challenge2-professional-portfolio

## Introduction

Challenge 2 is an assignment to create our own portfolio webpage. This offers a good opportunity to be creative by starting from scratch. This also makes for a great way to understand how CSS is used to pull a page together and primarily how it is responsive when viewed from a mobile device.

## Installation

To install this project, simply clone the repository:
    git clone git@github.com:Tdegirol/challenge1-refactor.git

## Usage

This project consisted of improving accessibility, best practices, and SEO. A good way to gauge success while refactoring is using the Lighthouse resource. This is done by viewing the deployed web application in browser and opening developer tools (see screenshot below):

Then click the arrows to open the dropdown and select lighthouse, and generator report as shown below:

In order to improve the HTML on this project, some semantic HTML was added, for example reducing the number of divs by including header or section instead. Search engine optimization under the content class was missing "id" which repaired the navigation link.
In order to improve the CSS code for best practices and create a more efficient/DRY code, classes/properties were combined as shown below:
