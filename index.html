                Hi I'm TJ DeGirolamo and welcome to my portfolio. My extensive web development background includes over 4 projects in the past few weeks exclusively through Columbia's coding bootcamp. I am currently exploring this new career path out of interest in programming which I was mildly exposed to during my years in school. </br>
                It started back in high school, I learned QBASIC which seemed to be the most primitive way to communicate with a computer. It layed the foundation to the simple principles of programming and sparked my interest. After entering college for computer engineering and going through just one C++ course, I said "NOT FOR ME!", and quickly changed my major to electrical engineering.</br>
                Now after years of working full time and taking one python course while getting my Masters degree, I decided it's time to go back to and chase something that genuinely is interesting. I'm excited to continue to explore this new path!
